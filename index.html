        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Homestead, Iowa. It is a very small town about 25 minutes west of 
            Iowa City. My parents both were raised in the same area, so I get to see many 
            other family members and friends often as well. I have always loved being in 
            Iowa, and that lead me to go to the University of Iowa. As a first generation
            student, there have been plenty of new challenges and opportunities. I will 
            always be thankful to be a Hawkeye.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming out of high school I had a strong interest and numbers and analytics.
            With that, I decided to major in business analytics at The Tippie College of 
            Business at the University of Iowa. After my freshman, year I also added business
            management as a major. Any job requires you to work with other people and the
            management major was something I knew would help me work on that skill.
            Being a double major was not what I envisined for myself
            growing up, but it has been a rewarding experience to go through.
