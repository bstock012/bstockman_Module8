        <h2>Notable Work Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            Below you will find brief information on some of the more notable work experiences
            I have been apart of. More information can be found on my LinkedIn page.

        <h3>CRST</h3>

        <p>
            The summer after my sophomore year I was an operations intern at CRST 
            Transportation in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This was my first experience in the 
            corporate world and a completely new environment for me. I was given a project 
            work on during my few months there and was able to give insights as to what could
            change in the certain processes.

        <h3>Tippie College of Business</h3>
        <p>
            This is a position I currently hold. I started hear at the beginning of my junior
            year. My work at Tippie includes supporting faculty with any requests they may
            have. This can include printing, ordering, event management, and more. I have 
            been able to build relationships with some of my instructors by being in this 
            position.
        </p>
        <h3>3E</h3>
        <p>
            The winter of 2024 I started on part-time at 3E in Iowa City. 3E is an electrical
            supplier that provides supplies, materials, and services to electrical companies
            around the area. I grew up around a blue collar environment and always enjoyed
            that kind of work. This company allows me to surround myself in that environment
            while also using what I learned at my time at the University of Iowa.
